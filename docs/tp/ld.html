<h4>Prep Time</h4>
  <p>Each debater gets 4 minutes of prep time, which can be used in any amount before a speech.</p>
<h4>Sides</h4>
<p>The two sides are Affirmative and Negative. Sometimes, sides are chosen at a tournament before match starts. Sometimes a coin flip is used instead.</p>
<h4>Topics</h4>
<p>LD topics are called Resolutions, and usually are about a concept that is somewhat broad, but not too broad. Resolutions usually include the words should or ought. The latter has an inherent moral component.</p>
<h4>Value and Criterion</h4>
<p>Every LD case has a Value and a Criterion. A value is a moral goal, such as liberty, justice, human rights or equality. A criterion is a more specific idea that describes how your contentions and arguments lead to the achievement of the value. In simpler terms: A value is what you want, and the criterion is how you achieve it.</p>
<h4>Contention</h4>
<p>A contention is a point in your larger case. A contention has a tagline, which defines what it is about, and one or more cards, which are pieces of evidence that back up the claim in the tagline. The contention and each card should contain explanation.</p>
<h4>Cards</h4>
<p>Cards are pieces of evidence in your case. Fun fact: Evidence in debate cases is called cards because in the time before computers, people would cut of evidence from a magazine or a scientific journal and put it on a 3 by 5 index card. Cards usually must come from  a reputable academic source, a reputable news publication, a government agency or others that have a similar reputation. Cards in a speech are usually introduced in a speech with something like "According to _," Cards can also be identified by using the last name of the main author and the last two digits of the year the publication was published, for example, "Can I see your Johnson '13 card?"</p>
<h4>Dropping</h4>
<p>Dropping refers to the act of not adressing an opponent's point in your rebuttal. If your opponent calls you out, this can usually result in a loss, so don't do it.</p>
