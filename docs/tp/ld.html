<h4>Prep Time</h4>
  <p>Each debater gets 4 minutes of prep time, which can be used in any amount before a speech.</p>
<h4>Sides</h4>
<p>The two sides are Affirmative and Negative. Sometimes, sides are chosen at a tournament before match starts. Sometimes a coin flip is used instead.</p>
<h4>Topics</h4>
<p>LD topics are called Resolutions, and usually are about a concept that is somewhat broad, but not too broad. Resolutions usually include the words should or ought. The latter has an inherent moral component.</p>
<h4>Value and Criterion</h4>
<p>Every LD case has a Value and a Criterion. A value is a moral goal, such as liberty, justice, human rights or equality. A criterion is a more specific idea that describes how your contentions and arguments lead to the achievement of the value. In simpler terms: A value is what you want, and the criterion is how you achieve it.</p>
<h4>Contention</h4>
<p>A contention is a point in your larger case. A contention has a tagline, which defines what it is about, and one or more cards, which are pieces of evidence that back up the claim in the tagline. The contention and each card should contain explanation.</p>
