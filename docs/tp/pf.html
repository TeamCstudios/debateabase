<h4>Prep Time</h4>
<p>Each team gets 2 minutes of prep time, which can be used in any amount before a speech.</p>
<h4>Sides</h4>
<p>The two sides are Pro and Con. A coin flip is used to pick sides.</p>
<h4>Topics</h4>
<p>PF topics are called Resolutions, and usually are about headline topics. Resolutions usually include the word should.</p>
<h4>Cards</h4>
<p>Cards are pieces of evidence in your case. Fun fact: Evidence in debate cases is called cards because in the time before computers, people would cut of evidence from a magazine or a scientific journal and put it on a 3 by 5 index card. Cards usually must come from  a reputable academic source, a reputable news publication, a government agency or others that have a similar reputation. Cards in a speech are usually introduced in a speech with something like "According to _," Cards can also be identified by using the last name of the main author and the last two digits of the year the publication was published, for example, "Can I see your Johnson '13 card?"</p>
<h4>Dropping</h4>
<p>Dropping refers to the act of not adressing an opponent's point in your rebuttal. If your opponent calls you out, this can usually result in a loss, so don't do it.</p>
